# Discourse

## Inspiration
More than a label. With Discourse, we're aiming to promote constructive, non-partisan discussion. Each week a curated list of current issues are added, and users can enter video debates to discuss these issues and engage with new perspectives. Following each debate, users enter something relevant they learned from their discussion partner, and the most notable reflections are archived in our issue database, chronicling a history of productive discussion. We're not trying to change what people think, but rather how they approach politics on an issue-to-issue basis.
## What it does
A selection of four curated issues are added each week. Users select an issue to discuss, and are matched with another user for a guided discussion of the issue, their perspective, and their respective solutions. After the discussion, each is asked to state one meaningful idea presented by the other, which are added to a list of reflections. Reflections may be liked by users, and the X most-liked reflections at the end of the week are archived.
## How we built it
The app was built in android, using Firebase for the reflection backend and Twilio for the video chats.
## Challenges we ran into
Everything.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
